Some time ago we have worked on an open source library at e.mundo, emubot, used to publish chatbots using a variety of NLP backends and messaging frontends. Since I am currently no longer actively working on NLP related topics, the libary likely requires some upgrades for the respective NLP/messenger APIs. 
However, the basic structure of the framework is still relevant and evolved over quite some take, including the use in customer projects.

If you are interested in some of the ideas behind emubot, feel free to take a lot at the [ACM XRDS article](https://doi.org/10.1145/3416059) (en). Another german article 
on this topic is freely available at [informatik-aktuell](https://www.informatik-aktuell.de/betrieb/kuenstliche-intelligenz/chatbot-zaehmen-leicht-gemacht.html).
