Another research project based on anomaly detection in ECG data was ECGAN. Using a one-class anomaly detection setting we have tried to generate solely normal class data (normal sinus rythms in case of ECG data). Based on this we developed a novel anomaly score using the distance in feature space, data space and latent space. 

The results have been summarized in an article at [informatik-aktuell (german)](https://www.informatik-aktuell.de/betrieb/kuenstliche-intelligenz/ecgan-reproduzierbares-maschinelles-lernen-fuer-ekg-daten.html), a [blog post](https://blog.e-mundo.de/post/ecgan-a-framework-for-reproducible-research-on-ecg-data/), two academic papers (a [conference paper](/activity/ieee2023) at IEEE ICDM 2023 and a [review paper](/activity/2024explorations) on GAN based anomaly detection in ACM SIGKDD Explorations) and an [open source framework](https://github.com/emundo/ecgan) for ECG generation and anomaly detection in time series data.

The project has been co-funded by the [Bavarian Research Foundation](https://forschungsstiftung.de/Projekte/Details/ECGAN-Erzeugung-und-Detektion-von-Anomalien-in-Zeitreihen-mit-Hilfe-von-Generative-Adversarial-Networks.html).
