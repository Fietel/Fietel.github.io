Our paper '_Adversarial Anomaly Detection using Gaussian Priors and Nonlinear Anomaly Scores_' was published at the [ICDM 2023 AI for time series analysis workshop](https://ai4ts.github.io/icdm2023). 

The focus on this work lies on using Generative Adversarial Networks to generate time series data and detect anomalies in a one-class classification setting. Main contributions are the usage of the Chi distribution to leverage information of the latent space to detect abnormal data in a joint anomaly score. In comparison to existing work we also do not use a normal linearly weighted score, which can be expensive to optimize, but a non-linear SVM: This is significantly faster for lower sample sizes (less than several million samples).

The preprint can be found on [arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.18091) and the final print will be part of the IEEE ICDMW proceedings.
