Our paper 'Anomaly Detection using Generative Adversarial Networks - Reviewing methodological progress and challenges' was published in [ACM SIGKDD Explorations](https://kdd.org/explorations).

In this work we have reviewed the challenges of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) in anomaly detection on a higher level. We dive a little deeper into what is actually usually done when using GANs in anomaly detection settings and into which problems one usually runs when doing so. Most challenges are also present in other generative approaches which can be used in anomaly detection settings. We further motivate how parts of the subproblems have been tackled by existing work. 

Core points of this work have been summarized in a short [blog post on GAN based anomaly detection](../posts/gan-based-anomaly-detection).
