Hey there, I am Fiete! I've started studying physics at the Technical University in Munich, but switched to economics quickly afterwards. After my B.Sc in econimics, I graduated in computer science with a minor in psychology and graduated rather recently. During my second Bachelor, I have mainly focused on working at [e-mundo](https://e-mundo.de/), where I lead a research projects regarding chatbots and NLP. I love to learn new things and after attending some academic conferences that focus on machine learning, I started to examine some models more in-depth. This has ultimately led to my bachelor thesis about anomaly detection in time series using GANs, where I try to investigate the general capabilities of GANs to detect anomalies.

I'd love to hear back from you, just shoot me an e-mail at [fieteblog@gmail.com](mailto:fieteblog-gmail.com)!

I might open source the code of my thesis (or, more likely, an updated version of it) on
[Github](https://github.com/Fietel)
