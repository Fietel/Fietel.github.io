Hey there, I am Fiete! I've started studying physics at the Technical University in Munich, but switched to economics quite soon. After receiving a B.Sc in economics, I graduated in computer science with a minor in psychology. During my second bachelor, I have mainly focused on working at [eMundo](https://e-mundo.de/), where I lead small research projects regarding chatbots and NLP. I love to learn new things and after attending some academic conferences that focus on different topics related to machine learning, I have started to examine some models more in-depth. This has ultimately led to my bachelor thesis about anomaly detection in time series using GANs, where I have tried to investigate the general capabilities of GANs to detect anomalies in such data, trying to find out how we could use them to detect anomalies in medical data. I will present some of the work at the ICDM 2019 PhD Forum in Beijing.

I'd love to hear back from you, you can contact me at [fieteblog@gmail.com](mailto:fieteblog-gmail.com)!

Since I have already enjoyed some open source work, I also aim to open source some work by myself, or at least help in its' creation. Currently, this has been limited only to small contributions (e.g. to the [d2l.ai book](https://www.d2l.ai/index.html)), but a larger project related to NLP will be open sourced quite soon. I might also open source the code of my thesis (or, more likely, an updated version of it) on
[Github](https://github.com/Fietel). Please pressure me a little bit if this interests you!
