## Short bio

Aftering finishing a B.Sc. in economics and another B.Sc. in computer science with a minor in psychology, I graduated with a M.Sc in computer science. During my computer science studies, I have mainly focused on working at [e.mundo](https://e-mundo.de/), where I have led several research projects: Up until early 2020 I have mainly worked on topics related to NLP focusing on conversational agents (see [emubot](../projects/emubot)). I have written my bachelor thesis about anomaly detection in time series using GANs, where I have tried to investigate the general capabilities of GANs to detect anomalies in such data, trying to find out how we could use them to detect anomalies in ECG data. Some of the findings have been summarized in a short abstract that I have presented at the ICDM 2019 PhD Forum in Beijing. Subsequently, I have applied for and received a research grant to continue working on this topic by the Bavarian Research Foundation, see [ECGAN](../projects/ecgan). In ECGAN [(official german description here)](https://forschungsstiftung.de/Projekte/Details/ECGAN-Erzeugung-und-Detektion-von-Anomalien-in-Zeitreihen-mit-Hilfe-von-Generative-Adversarial-Networks.html), we have investigated limitations of some anomaly detection approaches in ECG data from a multitude of angles: This includes practical and medical considerations as well as computational or algorithmical limits of GANs. Since the training of GANs often has less ups than downs, the work has increased my interest in related topics, especially more general thoughts on manifold learning/geometric DL.

## Current focus and research interests

I am currently involved in a variety of internal and external research topics, trying to focus on using ML to benefit the lives of others.
Since ECGAN I have tried to dig deeper into a variety of other topics ranging from optimizing of energy consumption to reduce the emissions, reducing emissions in traffic, securing vulnerable road users as well as supporting projects in medicine/caretaking with our SW/ML capabilities. 

## Bridging the gap between industry and academia
Due to my current focus I can sometimes allocate time which are in the area between academic and industrial research: I try to stay close to the academic process (e.g. by attending major academic conferences, reviewing for conferences such as IEEE ICDM and journals such as Springer Nature Artifical Intelligence Review) while also not needing to either strict industrial conditions (I dont need to improve an existing product) or academic obligations (e.g. the need to publish). 
Since I have already enjoyed the benefits of various open source libraries, I also aim to publish as much of my work as open source as possible, or at least help in its creation. In the beginning, this has been limited only to small contributions (e.g. minor corrections to the [d2l.ai book](https://www.d2l.ai/index.html) or the [UMAP](https://github.com/lmcinnes/umap) docs). I have since then published the [emubot](https://github.com/emundo/emubot) framework, a [benchmarking tool](https://github.com/emundo/nlutestframework) to compare the performance of some NLU platforms as well as [ecgan](https://github.com/emundo/ecgan).
