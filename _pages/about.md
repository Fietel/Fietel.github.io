Hey there, I am Fiete! I've started studying physics at the Technical University in Munich, but switched to economics quite soon. After receiving a B.Sc in economics, I graduated in computer science with a minor in psychology. During my second bachelor, I have mainly focused on working at [eMundo](https://e-mundo.de/), where I lead small research projects: Up until 2020 I have mainly worked on topics related to NLP focusing on chatbots.
After attending some conferences that focus on a variety of topics related to machine learning, I have started to examine some models more in-depth. This has ultimately led to my bachelor thesis about anomaly detection in time series using GANs, where I have tried to investigate the general capabilities of GANs to detect anomalies in such data, trying to find out how we could use them to detect anomalies in medical data. Some of our findings have been summarized in a short abstract that I have presented at the ICDM 2019 PhD Forum in Beijing. Currently I am waiting for some feedback on a research grant to continue working on anomaly detection in electrocardiograms, which will be my main focus during 2020/2021.

Since I have already enjoyed some open source work, I also aim to open source some work by myself, or at least help in its' creation. While this has previously been limited only to small contributions (e.g. to the [d2l.ai book](https://www.d2l.ai/index.html)), we have since published the [emubot](https://github.com/emundo/emubot) framework and a [benchmarking tool](https://github.com/emundo/nlutestframework) to compare the performance of some NLU platforms.
I'd love to hear back from you. It is possible to contact me at [fieteblog@gmail.com](mailto:fieteblog-gmail.com).
