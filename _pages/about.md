Hey there, I am Fiete!

## Short Bio

I've started studying physics at the Technical University in Munich, but switched to economics quite soon. After receiving a B.Sc. in economics and another B.Sc. in computer science with a minor in psychology, I graduated computer science. During my computer science studies, I have mainly focused on working at [eMundo](https://e-mundo.de/), where I lead research projects: Up until early 2020 I have mainly worked on topics related to NLP focusing on conversational agents (see [emubot](../projects/emubot). I have written my bachelor thesis about anomaly detection in time series using GANs, where I have tried to investigate the general capabilities of GANs to detect anomalies in such data, trying to find out how we could use them to detect anomalies in ECG data. Some of the findings have been summarized in a short abstract that I have presented at the ICDM 2019 PhD Forum in Beijing. Subsequently, I have applied for and received a research grant to continue working on this topic by the Bavarian Research Foundation (BFS).

## Research interests

In my current project, ECGAN [(official german description here)](https://forschungsstiftung.de/Projekte/Details/ECGAN-Erzeugung-und-Detektion-von-Anomalien-in-Zeitreihen-mit-Hilfe-von-Generative-Adversarial-Networks.html), we are investigating limitations of some anomaly detection approaches in ECG data from a multitude of angles: This includes practical and medical considerations as well as computational or algorithmical limits of GANs. Since the training of GANs often has less ups than downs, the present work has increased my interest in related topics, especially more general thoughts on manifold learning/geometric DL.
Since I have already enjoyed the benefits of various open source libraries, I also aim to publish as much of my work as open source as possible, or at least help in its creation. In the beginning, this has been limited only to small contributions (e.g. minor corrections to the [d2l.ai book](https://www.d2l.ai/index.html) or the [UMAP](https://github.com/lmcinnes/umap) docs). I have since then published the [emubot](https://github.com/emundo/emubot) framework and a [benchmarking tool](https://github.com/emundo/nlutestframework) to compare the performance of some NLU platforms. The current ECGAN project will also be available as open source code in the near future.
